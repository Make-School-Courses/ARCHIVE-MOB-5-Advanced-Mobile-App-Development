# Advanced iOS App Development

## Course Overview

The goal of this class is to build a video Q&A app modeled after the Whale iOS App. We will focus on building only a subset of features of the Whale app, with a focus on **netwoking**, **architecture** and a bit of fun with video with **AVFoundation**. 

## Objectives & Competencies

1. Build an iOS app from an API specification
2. Use AVFoundation to play, record and save videos & photos
3. Leverage advanced Swift features to architect your app
4. Build common app features like networking, authentication, pagination

### Spec Project

Key features:
1. Download JSON, Images and Video and display them
2. Work with AVFoundation to play, edit and save video and images
3. Manage and use multiple dependencies in your project
4. Add pagination for a seamless user experience
5. Use multiple persistence technologies(Keychain, UserDefaults, CoreData) to save user data
